## Features
➕ Create *Container* and add any files/folder you want with drag & drop

🔗 You can also select a folder to display its contents

🔤 Name the Container, move it, resize it, recolor it as you like

💾 Containers content and property are automatically saved (`%AppData%\DesktopContainer\`), when a Container is emptied the save file is deleted

📌 You can pin any Container to keep it in front of other windows

↔️ You can reorganize, delete one or all items by right-clicking on them.
