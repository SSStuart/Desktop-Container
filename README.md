## Features
➕ Create *Container* and add any files/folder you want with drag & drop

🔤 Name the Container, move it, and resize it as you like

📌 You can pin any Container to keep it in front of other windows

↔️ You can reorganize and delete Container's item by right clicking them

## Know issues ⚠️
- The Containers don't always stay on the desktop
